# dnd-charsheet-vue

I decided to create this Dungeons&Dragons character sheet manager and character generator as an excercise in Vue.js framework.

DnD character generation logic and flow provides variety of problems to solve.

It's not as content-complete as some of the commercial ones and it's not intended for profit.


``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

Built based on Nilotpal Chanda's vue-axios example.
