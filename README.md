# dnd-charsheet-vue

I decided to create this Dungeons&Dragons character sheet manager and character generator as an excercise in Vue.js framework.

DnD character generation logic and flow provides variety of problems to solve.

It's not as content-complete as some of the commercial ones and it's not intended for profit.


``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
